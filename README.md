## Inspiration
We've observed the difficulties faced by local farmers in Kenya, particularly regarding crop disease identification and management. Traditional methods can be time-consuming, lack accuracy, and require significant expertise.
Many smallholder farmers lack access to advanced technologies and resources that could significantly improve their crop yields and overall farm management.
The emergence of new crop diseases and the impact of climate change pose a significant threat to global food security. We believe innovative solutions are crucial to ensure a stable food supply.
We envision a future where farmers, regardless of their location or background, have access to powerful AI-powered tools like Project Ag Vision. This empowers them to make informed decisions about their crops and achieve greater success.
